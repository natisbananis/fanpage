            <p id="aboutSummary">Maluma gained early fame as a teenager. He originally pursued football as a vocation, and was gifted enough to attract the notice of the media in his native Medellin. He sang simply for pleasure. Given the rise of the internet, YouTube, and television singing competitions, however, he was pulled toward music. In 2011, at the age of 17, Maluma cut his first single, "Farandulera," independently. Due to its internet popularity and emergent radio airplay, the song gained the attention of Sony Music. The following year, Maluma released Magia, his debut album. Several of its singles -- "Obsesi√≥n," "Loco," and "Miss Independent" -- received consistent airplay and hit the charts in Colombia and Latin America. His next single, "La Temperatura," entered the North American charts and earned him a Latin Grammy nomination in 2013.</p>
